# Getting Started 

Veda AI is designed to help you create apps faster, smarter, and with fewer manual steps. Whether you want to generate entire screens from a sentence or tweak individual components using simple prompts, the AI Chatbot is here to make things smoother.

##  Set Up Your OpenAI API Key

To begin using the AI features, you need to make sure the platform has access to an OpenAI API key.

- Go to **DronaHQ Cloud**.
- Open your **Profile Settings**.
- Navigate to the **Integrations** tab.
- Click on **OpenAI Account Settings**.

From here, you can either:

- Use DronaHQâ€™s default OpenAI key â€” great for quick experimentation.
- Or bring your own OpenAI key â€” ideal if you want lower costs or higher usage limits.

To know more refer to our [Configure OpenAI keys](/building-with-ai/ai-configure-openai-keys/) documentation.

Once your key is added, youâ€™re ready to start building with AI!

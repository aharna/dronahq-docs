## Installation

You can install the DronaHQ extension using two methods: directly from the marketplace or from a `.vsix` file.

### 1. Installing Directly from the Marketplace

This is the recommended and easiest method.

1.  Open your code editor.
2.  Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon on the Activity Bar or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3.  Search for "**DronaHQ**".
4.  Click the "**Install**" button for the official DronaHQ extension.
5.  Alternatively, you can install it directly from the Visual Studio Marketplace: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dronahq-dev.dronahq](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dronahq-dev.dronahq)

### 2. Installing from a `.vsix` File

This method is useful for offline installation or for installing a specific version of the extension.

1.  Open your code editor.
2.  Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the **Command Palette**.
3.  Type and select: `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`

## Using the DronaHQ Code Editor Extension

Once installed, you can access all DronaHQ-related commands via the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`). Simply type "**DronaHQ**" to filter the available commands.

### **Initial Setup & Authentication**

To get started, you'll need to connect your code editor to your DronaHQ workspace. We recommend using the following method for the smoothest experience.

#### Login via DronaHQ Studio (Recommended)

This approach provides a seamless, passwordless authentication flow.

1.  Log in to your **DronaHQ studio**.
2.  Navigate to the **Code Editor** extension and click to open your preferred editor.

3.  A passwordless authentication screen will appear in your browser. Click the **Authorize** button.
4.  Your browser will prompt you to open the link in your code editor.

:::note 
Check **"Don't ask again for this link type"** on the first prompt so the editor opens the correct window automatically every time.
:::

#### **Alternative Method: Login via Code Editor**

If you prefer to authenticate directly from your editor, you can use the built-in command.

* Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and use the **`DronaHQ: Login`** command (`Ctrl+Shift+L`) to connect to your DronaHQ workspace.

* Use the **`DronaHQ: List all apps`** command to load your application files into your editor.

### Preview 
* To see your changes live, you can:
    * Preview the app locally in your code editor with **`DronaHQ: Preview App`** (`Ctrl+Alt+P`) while editing.
    * View changes in the DronaHQ studio after you've committed them.

* When you're ready to save your changes to the DronaHQ platform, use **`DronaHQ: Commit Changes to App`** (`Ctrl+Shift+S`).

* It's a good practice to **`Export App`** (`Ctrl+Alt+E`) to create a backup before making any significant changes. This saves a `.zip` file of your app locally.

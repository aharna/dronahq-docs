# **Multi-View Container**

The **Multi-View Container** is a specialized control designed to display a single, active view from a collection of pre-configured containers. Unlike the `Tabbed Container`, its tabs are not visible to the end-user. The active view is controlled programmatically via a `default` formula or use `radio` option via manual mode, making it ideal for creating dynamic, single-page interfaces or complex, multi-step workflows.



This control is particularly useful for:

  - Building multi-step forms that guide users through a process.
  - Displaying content conditionally based on application state or user data.
  - Creating a unified user experience without the visual clutter of tabs.
  - Grouping complex functionalities within a single container, switching views based on business logic.



## Content

The Multi-view Container’s configuration is comprehensive, offering various ways to define and manage its content.

- **Manual:** Allows developers to manually configure the tabs and their corresponding content.
- **Mapped:** Dynamically generate tabs by mapping data from external sources.
- **View Data:** Preview the data being rendered in the tabs to ensure accuracy.



### Add-ons
- **Tooltip:** Add tooltips to provide contextual information about each tab.
- **Description:** Include detailed descriptions for better user understanding.
- **Label:** Customize the labels for each tab such as its size, height, color and alignment.


:::info

In the Multi-view Container, If the tab value is altered, then the associated controls will be automatically removed. This is because the system maps controls based on the value key, not the label.  

It is best to:
- First set the tab value and then inject the controls accordingly to ensure they persist.
- Modify the tab label as it is safe and will not affect the controls.

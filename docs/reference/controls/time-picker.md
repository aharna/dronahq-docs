The Time Picker control allows users to input the desired time in a microapp by selecting it from a clock widget, or by typing manually. You have the flexibility to either set the user's device time as the default time or leave the Time Picker empty when presenting it to the user. Time picker saves the time in Unix epoch time format by default, and various other formats can also be specified. This versatile control can serve multiple purposes, such as setting meeting times or making reservations.

## Binding Data Options

To populate data in the Time Picker control, you have several options for binding the time. You can provide the time using static data options in either the UNIX timestamp format or the JavaScript `Date` object format or any other formula.

#### Examples

```jsx title="UNIX timestamps in milliseconds"
1753800808000
```
```jsx title="JavaScript Date object"
new Date('2025-07-29T15:55:51.000Z')
```
```jsx title="Moment object"
moment().add(30, 'minutes')
```

For instance, consider a scenario where you are building an appointment scheduling application and you need to set specific times for appointments, you can bind a formula of your choice or a reference, as per requirement.

## Content

- **Time format:** Choose the format for the time to be displayed, either `12 Hours` or `24 Hours` format.
- **Manage time zone:** Enable this toggle to control the time zones for display purpose and the output value. Below properties become configurable when it is enabled.
  - **Display:** The time is displayed in the input field as per the time zone selected here.
  - **Value:** Output value is received as per the time zone selected here.
- **Submit Format:** Choose `Local` or `UTC` time zone for the time being displayed. It becomes configurable when *Manage time zone* is disabled.

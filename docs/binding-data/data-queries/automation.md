DronaHQ offers a powerful Automation feature that allows you to automate tasks based on trigger events such as scheduled timings or webhooks from third-party services. With Automation, you can streamline repetitive processes and schedule various activities within your apps on DronaHQ's platform.

## Prerequisites
### Configuring Your Automation:

To set up automation, begin by reviewing the [Automation Overview documentation.](https://docs.dronahq.com/automations/overview/ ) It provides step-by-step guidance on defining automation triggers, connecting tasks or connectors, testing flows, and publishing your automation workflows. You can access the official guide here:


## Query Execution Details:

- `Name:` Specifies the query's identifier or name for easy reference within DronaHQ.
- `Run Query:` Choose between two options:
  - **Every Time Variable Changes:** Set the query to automatically execute whenever associated variables are modified, ensuring real-time updates based on dynamic changes.
  - **Manual Trigger Only:** Opt for manual activation, enabling control over when the query executes, ideal for specific instances or user-triggered actions.
- `Proxy Call Toggle:` This toggle determines whether the query will utilize a proxy call mechanism:
  - **Enabled:** Utilize a proxy call for handling GET requests, ensuring efficient management and seamless integration with the designated endpoint.
  - **Disabled:** Bypass the proxy call, directly executing the query without intermediary handling.

### Variables


- `Automation Value:` Select the automation you wish to use.
